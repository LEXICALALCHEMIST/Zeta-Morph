ZetaMorph: The Zero-Logic Symbolic Math Engine

ZetaMorph is a post-logic, symbolic computation engine that replaces traditional math with state-based morphic collapse.

Instead of operating on values, ZetaMorph manipulates structure, pressure, and recursive symbolic rules to perform math without logic or memory.

Zeta decomposes data structure to its litteraly quantum shape in the smallest form. Then Morph Engine generates a sequence of near 0 text 
a Morph Sequence that the skelton listener is compatible with. Pre coded math growth patterns use the sequence to manipulate the state
with recursive lexical preessure of the dom, skeleton modification. The GPU never touched, the transaction never occured except locally on screen. O Math | Math ` 0 GPU | Logic ` No Attack Surface | No Gas | Data Teleportaion

Key Concepts

Skeletons represent morphic units (<●●●|●●●|●●●>)

MorphOps (Push, Pull, Collapse, Shift) modify Skeletons

No if/else, no loops, no arithmetic operators

Logic is emergent through state transitions, not executed

Core Modules

File Description

morphEngine.js Main symbolic processor
skeletonComposer.js Builds Skeletons from intent
collapseOps.js Defines all MorphOps
demoAdd.js Sample: perform 27 + 15 morphically



---

Example: Add 27 + 15

const morph = require('./morphEngine');

const result = morph.add(27, 15);
// Output: symbolic collapse to 42 via push/pull/shift ops


---

Why It Matters

Infinite scale with minimal structure

Executes securely on user devices

No power cost, no logic stack, no memory to exploit

Foundation of post-logic computing + LSD economy
